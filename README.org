* What Is It?

Sarvik (Estonian for "antlered animal") is a static website generator
aimed at people with programming knowledge.  It's main task is to make
the hierarchical structure of your site's content (which already present
in the filesystem) available to programs (usually some kind of
templating system).

This is currently a work in progress.
